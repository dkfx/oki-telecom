Author's README file:


Here are my changes to 4712-prg.c.   The program will now loop, allowing 
you to enter all 5 ESN's & NAM's before exiting.  Upon exiting the loop
you will be asked which pair to use.   This program expects your security
code to be 123456, if it is not, either change the security code or change
the program code and re-compile.

The program sometimes doesn't enter the test mode, so if you watch the
display and the NAM doesn't get programmed, just enter that pair again.
If anyone knows of a fix for this bug, please let me know.

In the near future look for my changes to SCAN which will allow you to
talk back.
