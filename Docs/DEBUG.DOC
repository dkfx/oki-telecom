                            OKI 900 - DEBUG MODE
==============================================================================


Here's some info on using the debug mode from the keypad.

Power the phone up.  Wait for PowerOn msg.  Hit 7 and 9 together.
Then hit Menu, Snd, End, Rcl, Sto, Clr.  Phone says good timing!
Debugger is now enabled, but phone works normally.  Hit 1 and 3
together to halt phone and enter debugger.  Everything on display
lights up.  Hit Clr, Clr till you get status display.

Now you can execute commands listed below.  For example to reboot phone
enter #, 0, 2, Snd.  Commands all start with # and end with Snd.  Some
take arguments.

You can use #25, to display memory in EEPROM, and I think once in
that command you can hit # and * to go up and down in memory, Clr to
exit.  Hex chars are entered as "*n", like *1=A, *2=B, etc.


SUSPEND     #01         Performs Initialization
